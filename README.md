# MiniCraftLauncher
 a launcher for MiniCraft+ and some other variants of the game. Not Minecraft related.

## Current functionality:

- Load versions from /MiniCraftLauncherIndex
- Double-click to download a version
- Double-click already downloaded version to launch it
- The launcher keeps track of downloaded versions on restart
- Under the Edit menu, go into the Select Channel submenu to switch between Release, Pre-Release, and Mod channels.

## Roadmap
- Add menu to open launcher folder
- Add right-click menu on version to open version folder (to access saves and configs)
- (Future) Allow self-updating via GitHub Releases
