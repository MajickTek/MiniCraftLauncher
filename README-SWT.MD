# SWT-WINDOWS
This branch is currently versioned `1.6.4` and contains a rewrite of the UI in SWT/JFace (as a direct port, not a redesign).

The libraries provided will ONLY work with 64-bit Windows systems.

Future plans for a new build system will allow switching natives at compile-time, and platform-agnostic code will allow the launcher to run on 64-bit Linux, macOS, and Windows systems.

At this time, ARM platforms such as macOS M1/M2 cannot be supported. Same can be said for 32-bit platforms.


The new build system and UI framework will pave the way towards Launcher 2.0 which _will_ have a UI redesign that is closer to classic game launchers and more user-friendly.
